                <p class="sentence"><strong>You used to get it in your fishnets</strong></p>
                <p class="sentence">Now you only get it in your night dress</p>
                <p class="sentence">Discarded all the naughty nights for niceness</p>
                <p class="sentence">Landed in a very common crisis</p>
                <p class="sentence">Everything's in order in a black hole</p>
                <p class="sentence">Nothing seems as pretty as the past though</p>
                <p class="sentence">That Bloody Mary's lacking in Tabasco</p>
                <p class="sentence yelling">Remember when you used to be a rascal?</p>
                <p class="sentence">Oh the boy's a slag</p>
                <p class="sentence">The best you ever had</p>
                <p class="sentence">The best you ever had is just a memory</p>
                <p class="sentence">And those dreams weren't as daft as they seem</p>
                <p class="sentence">Not as daft as they seem,</p>
                <p class="sentence yelling">My love, when you dream them up...</p>
                <p class="sentence">Flicking through a little book of sex tips</p>
                <p class="sentence">Remember when the boys were all electric?</p>
                <p class="sentence">Now when she's told she's gonna get it</p>
                <p class="sentence">I'm guessing that she'd rather just forget it</p>
                <p class="sentence">Clinging to not getting sentimental</p>
                <p class="sentence">Said she wasn't going but she went still</p>
                <p class="sentence">Likes her gentlemen not to be gentle</p>
                <p class="sentence">Was it a Mecca dauber or a betting pencil?</p>
                <p class="sentence">Oh the boy's a slag</p>
                <p class="sentence">The best you ever had</p>
                <p class="sentence">The best you ever had is just a memory</p>
                <p class="sentence">And those dreams weren't as daft as they seem</p>
                <p class="sentence">Not as daft as they seem,</p>
                <p class="sentence yelling">My love, when you dream them up</p>
                <p class="sentence">Oh, Flo, where did you go?</p>
                <p class="sentence">did you go?</p>
                <p class="sentence">Where did you go? Whoa.</p>
                <p class="sentence">Falling about</p>
                <p class="sentence">You took a left off Last Laugh Lane</p>
                <p class="sentence">Just sounding it out</p>
                <p class="sentence">But you're not coming back again.</p>
